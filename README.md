# NC-News Frontend Project

This is a website built using my previously created backend api. The website was created using react, HTML and CSS for the frontend. It displays various news articles which can be sorted and filtered.
Users can like/dislike articles as well as comment on them and delete their own comments, all of which will update the backend database accordingly.



## Getting started
Please follow this link to find the hosted site - 

https://will-mcb-nc-news.netlify.app/

I will give details further down on how to run the project locally on your machine.


To use the 'comment' and 'delete comment' feature please navigate to the 'users' page and pick a user to sign in as. All other features can be used without signing in. 

Please find the backend API repo used to create the website here -
